# WeakRSZcrack
Bitcoin Signature Vulnerability Analyzer:This Python-based program is a cryptographic forensic tool designed to analyze Bitcoin transactions and detect potential vulnerabilities in ECDSA signatures. Its primary purpose is to identify reused or weak r values in digital signatures, which can potentially lead to the extraction of private keys

BTC Signature Checker
=====================

Description:
------------
This program analyzes Bitcoin transactions for weak or reused ECDSA signatures.

- Supports SegWit addresses (starting with `bc1`)
- Detects reused `r` values in digital signatures
- Extracts and analyzes digital signature components
- Helps identify potential cryptographic vulnerabilities

Security:
---------
The software is protected by one-time activation passwords.

- The password is bound to a specific device
- It cannot be used on another device
- Once activated, the same device can use it indefinitely

System Requirements:
--------------------
No installation required for the .exe version.

For Python (.py) version:
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Required libraries:
    pip install requests
    pip install ecdsa

How to Use:
-----------
1. Run the file BTCSignatureChecker.exe
2. Enter the activation password you received after purchase
3. Input a Bitcoin address (must start with `bc1`)
4. The program will scan transactions and list any cryptographic weaknesses
